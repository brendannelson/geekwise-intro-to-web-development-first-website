                    There was a time, a time before cable, when the local anchorman reigned supreme, when people believed everything they heard on TV. This was an age when only men were allowed to read the news. And in San Diego, one anchorman was more man than the rest. His name was Ron Burgundy. He was like a god walking amongst mere mortals. He had a voice that could make a wolverine purr, and suits so fine they made Sinatra look like a hobo. In other words, Ron Burgundy was the balls.

                    <strong>I look good.</strong> I mean, really good. Hey, everyone! Come and see how good I look! Ribs. I had ribs for lunch. That's why I'm doing this. How now brown cow? How now brown cow? How now brown cow? How are you? You look awfully nice tonight. Maybe don't wear a bra next time. No, I was talking to you. No, not her. I don't know her name. What is it? Lanolin? Lanolin? Like sheep's wool? Unique New York. I love Scotch. I love Scotch. Scotchy, Scotch, Scotch. Here is goes down. Down into my belly. The arsonist has oddly shaped feet. How much time? 30? 30 seconds? - You are on. - I'm on right now? I don't believe you. Ron! Oh, come on. Audrey. I look like hell. I got bags under my eyes. What's that? If you were a man, I'd punch you right in the mouth. That's bush. Bush league. The Human Torch was denied a bank loan. You hear me? Audrey, look at me! I'm sorry. All right? I'm sorry. All right, we're on. Ready, Phil. We're on in five, four... When the clock struck 6:00, it meant one thing for Ron Burgundy and his news team: Go time. Channel 4 News, with five-time Emmy award-winning anchor Ron Burgundy.
